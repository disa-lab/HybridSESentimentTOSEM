# Replication Package for "An Empirical Study of the Effectiveness of an Ensemble of Stand-alone Sentiment Detection Tools for Software Engineering Datasets"

- The file "SentiseadCode.zip" contains the source code of Sentisead using Random Forest.
- https://www.kaggle.com/giasuddin/hybridsentiment contains the code we used to experiment with advanced language-based pre-trained transformer models (PTM)
- The file "Results in Invididual Datasets.docx" shows performance of individual and hybrid tools on the entire datasets as well as the six datasets.
- The file "ResultsConsolidatedWithEnsambleAssessment_BERTLabeledFinal.xlsx" contains all the data we used to answer RQ1-RQ8.
  The following columns are necessary in the above file to understand the data:
  "File" colmun shows the six studied datasets. This column also shows the folds per file that we used. For example, "DatasetLinJIRA_Cleaned_test_0" denotes the fold 0 in the Lin et al. JIRA dataset, "DatasetLinJIRA_Cleaned_test_1" denotes fold 1, etc.
